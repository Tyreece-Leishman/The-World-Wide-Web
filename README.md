# The-World-Wide-Web
In this project, I discussed the key principles on which the World Wide Web functions.

## Start with the HTML Structure:

I began by defining the HTML document using `<!DOCTYPE html>` to declare it as an HTML5 document. I created the main structure using the `<html>` element, specifying the language attribute as `en` (English).

## Create the Head Section:

Inside the `<head>` section, I added various meta tags for character encoding and viewport settings. I provided a title for my web page using the `<title>` element. I linked a favicon using the `<link>` element. I also included `<link>` elements to preconnect to Google Fonts and load font styles.

## Define the Page Content:

The main content of my web page was enclosed within the `<body>` element. I created a `<header>` section containing a centered `<h1>` (main heading) and a `<p>` (paragraph) with an explanation of the World Wide Web.

## Add Horizontal Line:

After the header, I inserted an `<hr>` element with a width of 80% to create a horizontal line.

## Create Main Content Sections:

For different sections of content (e.g., "The Internet," "Webpages," "Browsers," etc.), I consistently followed this structure:

- Added a subheading using `<h2>`.
- Inserted an image using the `<img>` element with an `alt` attribute and styling.
- Provided an explanatory paragraph using the `<p>` element.

## List of Browsers:

In the "Browsers" section, I used an unordered list (`<ul>`) to list common browsers and used list items (`<li>`) for each browser.

## Table for URLs:

In the "URLs" section, I added a table using the `<table>` element with table rows (`<tr>`) for headers and data. I used table data cells (`<td>`) for each component (Protocol, Subdomain, Domain, File path).

## Repeat the Structure:

I repeated the structure for other sections ("DNS," "Putting it all together") similarly.

## Complete the Document:

I ended the main content with another horizontal line using `<hr>`.

## Final Section:

In the "Putting it all together" section, I provided an ordered list (`<ol>`) with list items (`<li>`) explaining the steps of what happens when visiting a webpage in a browser.

## Closing Tags:

I ensured that all opening tags had corresponding closing tags to maintain proper HTML structure.

## Inline CSS Styles:

I applied inline CSS styles to elements (e.g., `style="text-align: center;"`) to control text alignment and other styling aspects.
