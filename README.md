## HTML Structure
- **Declaration**: Started by declaring the document as an HTML5 one with `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
- **Document Structure**: Established the main structure using the `<html>` element, setting the language attribute to `en` (English).

## Head Section
- **Metadata**: In the `<head>` section, I included various meta tags for character encoding and viewport settings.
- **Title**: Gave the page a title using the `<title>` element.
- **Favicon**: Linked a favicon with the `<link>` element.
- **Font Styles**: Included `<link>` elements to preconnect to Google Fonts and load font styles.

## Page Content
- **Body Element**: The main content was enclosed within the `<body>` element.
- **Header**: Created a `<header>` section containing a centered `<h1>` (main heading) and a `<p>` (paragraph) explaining the World Wide Web.

## Visual Break
- **Horizontal Line**: Following the header, I inserted an `<hr>` element with a width of 80% to create a visual break.

## Main Content Sections
For different content sections (e.g., "The Internet," "Webpages," "Browsers," etc.), I consistently followed this structure:
- **Subheading**: Added a subheading using `<h2>`.
- **Image**: Inserted an image using the `<img>` element with an `alt` attribute and styling.
- **Explanatory Paragraph**: Provided an explanatory paragraph using the `<p>` element.

## List of Browsers
- In the "Browsers" section, I used an unordered list (`<ul>`) to list common browsers and used list items (`<li>`) for each browser.

## Table for URLs
- In the "URLs" section, I added a table using the `<table>` element with table rows (`<tr>`) for headers and data. I used table data cells (`<td>`) for each component (Protocol, Subdomain, Domain, File path).

## Repeated Structure
- I maintained a consistent structure for other sections ("DNS," "Putting it all together").

## Completing the Document
- Ended the main content with another horizontal line using `<hr>`.

## Final Section
- In the "Putting it all together" section, I provided an ordered list (`<ol>`) with list items (`<li>`) explaining the steps of what happens when visiting a webpage in a browser.

## Closing Tags
- Ensured that all opening tags had corresponding closing tags to maintain proper HTML structure.

## Inline CSS Styles
- Applied inline CSS styles to elements (e.g., `style="text-align: center;"`) to control text alignment and other styling aspects.
