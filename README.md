## Introduction

The World Wide Web, often referred to as 'the web,' is a global information-sharing platform that relies on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to provide access to information over the internet. It is built on top of the internet infrastructure and facilitates seamless communication between devices across the network by using common protocols.

## How It Works

Here's a step-by-step guide to what happens each time you visit a webpage through your browser:

1. The user enters a URL into the browser (e.g., www.example.com).

2. The browser queries a DNS server to find the domain's IP address.

3. The DNS server provides the IP address of the file server.

4. The browser requests the desired file from the server with the obtained IP address.

5. The server responds by delivering the requested file to the browser.

6. The browser displays the file to the user.
